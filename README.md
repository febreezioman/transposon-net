# Analysis of a similarity network of Tc-mar transposon copies

## Abstract
A similarity network of Tc-mar transposon sequences was acquired from (.......) Various properties of the network were analyzed, including ..... Metrics relating to such properties allow for additional quantitative analysis of lineages than was previously available, and this similarity network of transposons is a perfect example. 

## Motivation
It has recently been proposed that biological lineages exist in a nested or multigenerational state, however, testing this hypothesis is a difficult endeaver. (....) Transposons offer a promising model in which to study nested lineages, as transposon lineages are nested within organismal lineages and identifying large populations of transposons only requires a whole-genome sequence. Phylogenies of transposons can be produced by comparing transposon copies in whole genome sequences, however, many families of transposons have high mutation rates and produced phylogenies may suffer from low resolution. By constructing networks of transposons based on each copy's sequence similarity, and subsequntly analyzing such similarity networks, hypotheses about transposon lineages can still be tested without assuming a phylogeny. This approach is taken
